# Open Speakers Database

## What is it? 
The Open Speakers Database is a crowd-sourced method for finding experts in your region on Open Access, Open Education and Open Data. You can visit a public version of the database here: https://lorrainechu3n.github.io/open_speakers_database/

## Can I add a speaker into the database? 
Yes! Please do. If you know someone in your country, region, or institution who can offer expertise on Open scholarship who isn't in the database, please add them to our database using this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFG9BLCOu21NfxbDjmzK7NThDWiRs7GjnLaFmLUXEkZU16jg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
